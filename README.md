# Kickstarter Statistics (Unofficial)
>Kickstarter is an American public-benefit corporation based in Brooklyn, New York, that maintains a global crowdfunding platform focused on creativity and merchandising. The company's stated mission is to "help bring creative projects to life". Kickstarter has reportedly received more than $1.9 billion in pledges from 9.4 million backers to fund 257,000 creative projects, such as films, music, stage shows, comics, journalism, video games, technology and food-related projects. [(Wikipedia, 24.05.18)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstarter)

The goal of this project is to represent interesting statistics about Kickstarter which include, but are not limited to, success rate, amount of money pledged and more! 
The main component is an interactive map which represents data for the highlighted country.  

>This project was part of the information visualization course from the University of Regensburg.
